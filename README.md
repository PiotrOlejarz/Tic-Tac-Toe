Hello!

Thank you for showing interest in my project. I have created a simple game called Tic Tac Toe and added some features of my own.

1. What's new?
  -You can set your nickname.
  -You can play a challenge game of 1-10 rounds with a friend.
  -The game saves the board and score from normal games and challenges.
  -After one round, the player who played as 'X' will play as 'O' to make it fair, since 'X' has an advantage.

2. How to install? It's simple! If you only want to download the game, just download the file "Tic Tac Toe Game" (without the source code), 
then open the file to start the game. The "Tic Tac Toe" file only contains the source code, for those who want to see how I made the game.
Finally, last file "Source and builded project" has game and source.
